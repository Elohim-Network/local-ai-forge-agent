/**
 * This is a simulated transcription endpoint
 * In a real application, this would be a server-side API that:
 * 1. Receives the audio file
 * 2. Uses a service like Whisper API or another STT service
 * 3. Returns the transcription result
 * 
 * To implement a real endpoint, you would need to:
 * - Set up a Node.js server (Express, Next.js API, etc.)
 * - Integrate with an STT service
 * - Handle authentication, rate limiting, etc.
